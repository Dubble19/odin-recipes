    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Now this is a recipe that has been dear to my heart for some time. Whenever I am low on time and need a calorific breakfast, this is my go to choice. It boasts over 800 calories with all natural ingredients, depending on your protein powder of course.<br>
       This is something that for myself has become a regular breakfast 5-6 days a week as its easy to eat, easy to package and take with me to work. It takes less than 5 minutes to prepare this meal which is grat for someone like me who likes spending as<br>
       little time in the kitchen as I can when it comes to prepping my meals.
