# odin-recipes

In this project I will be demostrating my understanding of different areas of HTML5.
Specifically creating a website presenting my favourite hard gainer recipies for muscle mass.
I will show basic HTML skills being able to produce multiple pages of content including:
Headings
Paragraphs
Images
hyperlinks
Bold and Italic text
use of relative and absolute images
nested elements
buttons
 I hope I use these and more coding tehcniques to produce these pages.
